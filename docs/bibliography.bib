A lumped parameter mathematical model, which is based on a one-dimensional formulation of the flow of an incompressible fluid in distensible vessels, is constructed using a bond graph formulation to ensure mass conservation and energy conservation. The model includes arterial vessels with geometric and anatomical data based on the ADAN circulation model. The peripheral beds are represented by lumped parameter compartments. We compare the hemodynamics predicted by the bond graph formulation of the cerebral circulation with that given by a classical one-dimensional Navier-Stokes model working on top of the whole-body ADAN model. Outputs from the bond graph model, including the pressure and flow signatures and blood volumes, are compared with physiological data.},

Commonly, such assessments have been performed by stereological approaches that rely on the extrapolation of two-dimensional data and provide very limited topological information. We present ex vivo optical tomographic data sets of the full $\beta$-cell mass distribution in cohorts of obese ob/ob mice and their lean controls, together with information about individual islet $\beta$-cell volumes, their three-dimensional coordinates and shape throughout the volume of the pancreas between 4 and 52 weeks of age. These data sets offer the currently most comprehensive public record of the $\beta$-cell mass distribution in the mouse. As such, they may serve as a quantitative and topological reference for the planning of a variety of in vivo or ex vivo experiments including computational modelling and statistical analyses. By shedding light on intra- and inter-lobular variations in $\beta$-cell mass distribution, they further provide a powerful tool for the planning of stereological sampling assessments.},

Model simulations are in good agreement with experimental data on (i) the quantitative contributions of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization under varying physiological states. (ii) the time courses of postprandial glycogen storage as well as glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term fasting (iii) the switch from net hepatic glucose production under hypoglycemia to net hepatic glucose utilization under hyperglycemia essential for glucose homeostasis (iv) hormone perturbations of hepatic glucose metabolism. Response analysis reveals an extra high capacity of the liver to counteract changes of plasma glucose level below 5 mM (hypoglycemia) and above 7.5 mM (hyperglycemia).

abstract = {Many biological, geophysical, and technological systems involve the transport of a resource over a network. In this paper, we present an efficient method for calculating the exact quantity of the resource in each part of an arbitrary network, where the resource is lost or delivered out of the network at a given rate, while being subject to advection and diffusion. The key conceptual step is to partition the resource into material that does or does not reach a node over a given time step. As an example application, we consider resource allocation within fungal networks, and analyze the spatial distribution of the resource that emerges as such networks grow over time. Fungal growth involves the expansion of fluid filled vessels, and such growth necessarily involves the movement of fluid. We develop a model of delivery in growing fungal networks, and find good empirical agreement between our model and experimental data gathered using radio-labeled tracers. Our results lead us to suggest that in foraging fungi, growth-induced mass flow is sufficient to account for long-distance transport, if the system is well insulated. We conclude that active transport mechanisms may only be required at the very end of the transport pathway, near the growing tips. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

We have developed a human microfluidic two-organ-chip model to study pancreatic islet–liver cross-talk based on insulin and glucose regulation. We have established a robust co-culture of human pancreatic islet microtissues and liver spheroids maintaining functional responses up to 15 days in an insulin-free medium. Functional coupling, demonstrated by insulin released from the islet microtissues in response to a glucose load applied in glucose tolerance tests on different days, promoted glucose uptake by the liver spheroids. Co-cultures maintained postprandial glucose concentrations in the circulation whereas glucose levels remained elevated in both single cultures. Thus, insulin secreted into the circulation stimulated glucose uptake by the liver spheroids, while the latter, in the absence of insulin, did not consume glucose as efficiently. As the glucose concentration fell, insulin secretion subsided, demonstrating a functional feedback loop between the liver and the insulin-secreting islet microtissues. Finally, inter-laboratory validation verified robustness and reproducibility. Further development of this model using tools inducing impaired glucose regulation should provide a unique in vitro system emulating human type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

We assessed the architecture and endocrine cell interaction of the vascular network in unperturbed human islets in situ and their potential to re-establish their endogenous vascular network after transplantation in vivo.We prepared slices of fresh pancreas tissue obtained from nondiabetic patients undergoing partial pancreatectomy. In addition, we transplanted human donor islets into the anterior chamber of the mouse eye. Next, we performed three-dimensional in situ and in vivo imaging of islet cell and vessel architecture at cellular resolution and compared our findings with mouse and porcine islets. Our data reveal a significantly different vascular architecture with decreased vessel diameter, reduced vessel branching, and shortened total vessel network in human compared with mouse islets. Together with the distinct cellular arrangement in human islets, this limits $\beta$ to endothelial cell interactions, facilitates connection of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ cells, and promotes the formation of independent $\beta$-cell clusters within islets. Furthermore, our results show that the endogenous vascular network of islets is significantly altered after transplantation in a donor agerelated mechanism. Thus, our study provides insight into the vascular architecture and cellular arrangement of human islets with apparent consequences for intercellular islet signaling. Moreover, our findings suggest that human islet engraftment after transplantation can be improved by using alternative, less mature islet-cell sources.},

Distilling geometric features into three parameters, obtained from image analysis and computational fluid dynamics,we capture archetypal features of the structure-function relationship of terminal villi using a simple algebraic approximation, revealing transitions between flow- and diffusionlimited transport at vessel and network levels. Our theory accommodates countercurrent effects, incorporates nonlinear blood rheology, and offers an efficient method for testing network robustness.

The utility of the model for basic research and applications in medicine and pharmacology is illustrated by simulating diurnal variations of the metabolic state of the liver at various perturbations caused by nutritional challenges (alcohol), drugs (valproate), and inherited enzyme disorders (galactosemia). Using proteomics data to scale maximal enzyme activities, the model is used to highlight differences in the metabolic functions of normal hepatocytes and malignant liver cells (adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma).},

abstract = {Development and homeostasis of organs and whole body is critically dependent on the circulatory system. In particular, the circulatory system, the railways shuttling oxygen and nutrients among various organs, is indispensible for inter-organ humoral communication. Since the modern view of the anatomy and mechanics of the circulatory system was established in 17 th century, it has been assumed that humoral factors are carried to and from organs via vascular branches of the central arteries and veins running along the body axis. Over the past few decades, major advances have been made in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the vascularization of organs. However, very little is known about how each organ is linked by vasculature (i.e., inter-organ vascular networks). In fact, the exact anatomy of inter-organ vascular networks has remained obscure. Herein, we report the identification of four distinct vessels, V1 LP , V2 LP , V3 LP and V4 LP , that bridge between two organs, liver and pancreas in developing zebrafish. We found that these inter-organ vessels can be classified into two types: direct and indirect types. The direct type vessels are those that bridge between two organs via single distinct vessel, to which V1 LP and V2 LP vessels belong. The indirect type bridges between two organs via separate branches that emanate from a stem vessel, and V3 LP and V4 LP vessels belong to this type. Our finding of V1 LP , V2 LP , V3 LP and V4 LP vessels provides the proof of the existence of inter-organ vascular networks. These and other yet-to-be-discovered inter-organ vascular networks may facilitate the direct exchange of humoral factors that are necessary for the coordinated growth, differentiation and homeostasis of the connected organs. It is also possible that the inter-organ vessels serve as tracks for their connected organs to follow during their growth to establish their relative positions and size differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Omae et al.},

Non-invasively detecting insulitis and $\beta$-cell decline would allow the diagnosis of eventual diabetes, and provide a means to monitor therapeutic intervention. However, there is a lack of validated clinical approaches for specifically and non-invasively imaging disease progression leading to T1D. Islets have a denser microvasculature that reorganizes during diabetes. Here we apply contrast-enhanced ultrasound measurements of pancreatic blood-flow dynamics to non-invasively and predictively assess disease progression in T1D pre-clinical models. STZ-treated mice, NOD mice, and adoptive-transfer mice demonstrate altered islet blood-flow dynamics prior to diabetes onset, consistent with islet microvasculature reorganization. These assessments predict both time to diabetes onset and future responders to antiCD4-mediated disease prevention. Thus contrast-enhanced ultrasound measurements of pancreas blood-flow dynamics may provide a clinically deployable predictive marker for disease progression in pre-symptomatic T1D and therapeutic reversal.},

abstract = {The capacity of the liver to convert the metabolic input received from the incoming portal and arterial blood into the metabolic output of the outgoing venous blood has three major determinants: The intra-hepatic blood flow, the transport of metabolites between blood vessels (sinusoids) and hepatocytes and the metabolic capacity of hepatocytes. These determinants are not constant across the organ: Even in the normal organ, but much more pronounced in the fibrotic and cirrhotic liver, regional variability of the capillary blood pressure, tissue architecture and the expression level of metabolic enzymes (zonation) have been reported. Understanding how this variability may affect the regional metabolic capacity of the liver is important for the interpretation of functional liver tests and planning of pharmacological and surgical interventions. Here we present a mathematical model of the sinusoidal tissue unit (STU) that is composed of a single sinusoid surrounded by the space of Disse and a monolayer of hepatocytes. The total metabolic output of the liver (arterio-venous glucose difference) is obtained by integration across the metabolic output of a representative number of STUs. Application of the model to the hepatic glucose metabolism provided the following insights: (i) At portal glucose concentrations between 6–8 mM, an intra-sinusoidal glucose cycle may occur which is constituted by glucose producing periportal hepatocytes and glucose consuming pericentral hepatocytes, (ii) Regional variability of hepatic blood flow is higher than the corresponding regional variability of the metabolic output, (iii) a spatially resolved metabolic functiogram of the liver is constructed. Variations of tissue parameters are equally important as variations of enzyme activities for the control of the arterio-venous glucose difference.},

abstract = {Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic $\beta$-cells is a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The main regulator of insulin secretion is the plasma glucose concentration. Insulin secretion is modified by other nutrients, circulating hormones and the autonomic nervous system, as well as local paracrine and autocrine signals. Autocrine signalling involves diffusible molecules that bind to receptors on the same cell from which they have been released. The first transmitter to be implicated in the autocrine regulation of $\beta$-cell function was insulin itself. The importance of autocrine insulin signalling is underscored by the finding that mice lacking insulin receptors in $\beta$-cells are glucose intolerant. In addition to insulin, $\beta$-cells secrete a variety of additional substances, including peptides (e.g. amylin, chromogranin A and B and their cleavage products), neurotransmitters (ATP and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) and ions (e.g. zinc). Here we review the autocrine effects of substances secreted from $\beta$-cells, with a focus on acute effects in stimulus-secretion coupling, present some novel data and discuss the general significance of autocrine signals for the regulation of insulin secretion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
